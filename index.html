                <h2>The Unseen Battle</h2>
                <p>As a skinny girl, I've often found myself facing a unique set of challenges. While society often glorifies thinness, I've experienced firsthand the hurtful comments and judgments that come with being perceived as "too skinny."</p>

                <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Being skinny means you're healthy</li>
                    <li>You're not eating enough</li>
                    <li>You're not feminine</li>

                <p>These misconceptions can be damaging and perpetuate negative body image.</p>

                <h2>The Impact on Mental Health</h2>
                <p>Constantly facing body shaming comments can lead to feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and anxiety. It's essential to recognize the harm these comments can cause and work towards creating a more supportive environment.</p>
